# Optimal Spacecraft

This is a a collection of two related projects. First, we model the n-body problem and try to find conditions that will allow us to slingshot a spacecraft around a heavy gravitational body. Second, we solve an optimal control problem to optimize the time and fuel-usage of the trajectory of a spacecraft headed towards a target destination.

We explore the effects of various different masses and initial conditions.  The goal is that the slingshot maneuver should allow the spacecraft to gain speed as it travels farther away from the center of the system.

To see our code for simulating and plotting gravitational dynamics, see the code folder, specifically [simulation.py](https://github.com/samcochran/optimal-spacecraft-control/blob/master/Code/simulation.py) and [plotting.py](https://github.com/samcochran/optimal-spacecraft-control/blob/master/Code/plotting.py). Our code for solving the optimal control problem is given in [control.py](https://github.com/samcochran/optimal-spacecraft-control/blob/master/Code/control.py).
